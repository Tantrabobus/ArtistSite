<p class="htext">Alexander Herrmann (1844-1896), also known as "Herrmann the Great" and "The Great Herrmann", was a French magician active in the late 1800s who is widely considered one of the greatest magicians ever.
<br>
<br>
"Magic shows at the time were usually serious affairs cloaked in mystery, and Herrmann broke with this tradition by introducing humor and joy into his acts. His stage shows raised magic to a new form of artistry, creating grand illusions that mystified audiences. He deployed lavish stage decorations to distract audiences as well as cleverly constructed props that looked deceivingly simple. For his famous “Escape from Sing Sing” act, he used body doubles as well as an elaborately constructed prison set with hidden compartments to feign shooting an escaped convict. Herrmann became world famous, and eventually had audiences of world leaders such as Queen Isabella II of Spain, President Abraham Lincoln, President Ulysses S. Grant, and Sultan Abdul Aziz, ruler of the Ottoman Empire. After Herrmann's death, his wife Adelaide performed for 25 more years - and became known as “The Queen of Magic."
